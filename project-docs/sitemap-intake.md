## What the Project Manager Needs

### For Each Page:
1. **Page Purpose**: What should this page accomplish?
2. **Target Audience**: Who is this page for?
3. **Key Content**: Main sections and messaging
4. **Required Assets**: Images, documents, forms needed
5. **Priority Level**: High/Medium/Low for development order

### Overall Site Goals:
- Primary website objective (lead generation, portfolio showcase, etc.)
- Key user journeys you want to support
- Any specific functionality requirements

## Next Steps
Once you provide the sitemap, the Project Manager will:
1. Analyze and organize the content structure
2. Create a development priority list
3. Identify required assets and content gaps
4. Coordinate with the Developer on technical implementation
5. Create a project timeline and milestones
