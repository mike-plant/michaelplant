## One-time audit

$500–650 depending on complexity.

You get a walkthrough and a short fix list you can implement yourself or hand off.

## Optional monthly maintenance

If you want ongoing help, this is lightweight maintenance. Not dependency.

## Fit matters

No hacks. No guarantees. Clear work, clear expectations.
