Google isn’t mysterious. It’s pattern-based.

## The 3 things Google says it uses

Relevance. Distance. Prominence.

You can’t control distance. You can control the rest.

## The fundamentals that matter first

Right category. Accurate hours. Real photos. Active review responses. Consistent business details.

## The point

You don’t need a 50-item checklist. You need the right few fixes in the right order.
