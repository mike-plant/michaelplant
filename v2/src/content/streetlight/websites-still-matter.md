Websites didn’t stop mattering.They just stopped being the starting point.

For most local businesses, discovery now happens on maps and local search. By the time someone clicks through to a website, they’re usually not discovering you — they’re confirming you.

That shift changes what a website is for.

### What websites are doing now

A website’s job today is simple: reinforce trust.

It answers quiet questions people don’t even realize they’re asking.Does this place feel real. Current. Consistent. Worth choosing.

When a site matches what someone just saw on Maps or search, confidence goes up. When it doesn’t, hesitation creeps in.

The mechanics of _why_ that happens live elsewhere. This page is about the role.

### How this fits with Streetlight

Streetlight focuses on the discovery layer — listings, maps, and local search.The website supports that layer by backing it up.

Not by ranking on its own.By agreeing with everything else.

That alignment is often the difference between being considered and being skipped.

### A note on the website itself

I’ve spent years building and working on websites as part of larger systems — not as isolated projects.

Sometimes that means small updates to keep things aligned.Sometimes it means rebuilding something that no longer fits how people actually search and decide.

If a site needs attention, I’ll say so.If it doesn’t, I won’t invent work.

This isn’t a separate pitch. It’s just part of seeing the whole picture.

### The point

Local search helps people find you.Your website helps them feel confident choosing you.

When those two agree, everything else gets easier.
