Most local businesses don’t have a marketing problem.They have a visibility problem.

People are already searching for what you offer. They’re on their phones, driving, looking in the moment. The decision about who shows up happens before anyone clicks a website.

Streetlight exists to remove the quiet friction that keeps good local businesses from being found.

### What Streetlight is

Streetlight helps local businesses show up more reliably on maps and local search by fixing the fundamentals that actually matter.

That means making sure your business information is accurate, consistent, and active across the places people — and search engines — check.

This isn’t traditional SEO.It’s about clarity, consistency, and follow-through.

### Who it’s for

Streetlight is for local businesses that depend on discovery.

Not businesses people already know by name — they’ll be found anyway.But businesses where someone is actively searching for what you offer and deciding who to trust.

Boutiques. Bookstores. Specialty services. Local operators where visibility drives growth.

### How Streetlight usually starts

Most work begins with a one-time audit and cleanup. That’s where inconsistencies get resolved, basics are fixed, and everything is put into clean working order.

From there, some people take it themselves.Some keep things moving with ongoing support.Both are valid.

### What Streetlight is not

It’s not for national brands chasing scale.It’s not for shortcuts or guarantees.It’s not mystery work.

We work with how local search actually behaves and explain what’s being changed along the way.

### The point

Being findable isn’t about winning Google.It’s about being there when someone nearby is looking for what you offer — and continuing to show up.

If that’s the problem you’re trying to solve, Streetlight is built for it.
