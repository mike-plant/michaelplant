Most local businesses don't have a marketing problem. They have a visibility problem.

People are already searching nearby. Maps decide who gets seen first.

## What Streetlight does

Streetlight helps you show up more reliably on Google Maps, Apple Maps, and local listings.

It's not a long contract. It's clarity, fixes that matter, and optional maintenance if you want it.

## Who it's for

Local businesses that depend on discovery. People searching for what you offer, not your name.

## What to do next

If you want a quick, clear starting point, begin with a one-time audit.
