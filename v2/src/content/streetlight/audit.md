The audit is a bounded walkthrough. Not a mystery report.

## What you get

A plain-language explanation of what's helping, what's hurting, and what matters first.

## What we check

Claimed status, accuracy, consistency across platforms, photos, reviews, and missing basics.

## Next step

If you want, I can run the audit for you and hand you a clear fix list.
