The audit is a starting point. Not a mystery report.

It’s a bounded walkthrough of your local presence to identify what’s helping, what’s hurting, and what actually matters first. The goal isn’t to overwhelm you or sell you something. It’s to remove guesswork.

This is the same process I use whether someone wants to understand things themselves or have me handle it.

### What I actually look at

I’m checking a small set of fundamentals that quietly control visibility:

*   Is your business properly claimed, or is Google relying on user-submitted data
*   Are your hours, phone number, address, and name accurate — and the same everywhere
*   Do your categories and services match how people actually search
*   Do your photos and activity show that the business is real and cared for
*   Are reviews being responded to, or ignored
*   Do Google, Apple Maps, Yelp, and other listings agree with each other

That’s it. No giant checklist. No tricks. Just the few things that move the needle.

### Why this works

Most businesses don’t struggle because they’re doing nothing.They struggle because a few basics are off, outdated, or quietly conflicting.

When that happens, Google hesitates. Rankings stall. Edits keep getting re-flagged. Visibility never quite improves, even when effort is being made.

The audit surfaces those blockers and puts them in the right order.

### What you can do with this

If you want to take this list and work through it yourself, you can.Nothing here is hidden or proprietary.

The value of the audit is that it:

*   Confirms what actually matters
*   Flags what can wait
*   Shows where effort will be wasted
*   Removes the “am I missing something?” feeling

If you’d rather not spend time tracking issues down across platforms, I can also handle the fixes for you — cleaning things up, aligning listings, and optionally keeping them from drifting again. Scope and expectations are always clear before anything starts.

### The point

Most businesses don’t need more marketing.They need fewer blockers.

Whether you use this as a reference, a second set of eyes, or something you hand off entirely, the goal is the same: make it easy for people nearby to actually find you.
