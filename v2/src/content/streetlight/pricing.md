Simple work. Clear pricing. No lock-in.

If you landed here first and want more context on _how_ this stuff actually works, you can check out the pages on what Google looks for or why consistency matters.If you already get it, this page is just the numbers and how to start.

### One-time audit & cleanup — **$599**

This is the initial fix.

After a short intake (a questionnaire and a quick call), I audit your listings and get everything into clean working order. Inconsistencies get corrected, categories and details are aligned, and obvious blockers are removed.

You’re not left with a report. You’re left with a solid, accurate foundation.

If you want more detail on what’s checked and why, the audit page walks through that. If you’re good with the overview, this is where we start.

### Ongoing consistency & maintenance — **$199 / month**

Optional.

This is for businesses that don’t want to think about this stuff once it’s set up.

I handle review responses, keep listings accurate across platforms, and post updates or photos so things stay active. If you want more momentum, we can increase activity. That’s always a conversation first.

If you skipped the explanation earlier and want to understand _why_ this matters long-term, the Google page covers it. If not, just know this is the part that keeps things moving.

Cancel anytime.

### Fit still matters

This is for local businesses that rely on being discovered by people searching nearby.

No hacks. No guarantees. Just fundamentals done well.

If you’re unsure whether this fits your situation, the main Streetlight page lays that out pretty clearly.

### Getting started

If you’re ready, send your business name or profile link and book a short call. If you’re still poking around, that’s fine too. Everything here will still make sense when you come back.
