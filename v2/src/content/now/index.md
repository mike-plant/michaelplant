A short rolling list of what I'm working on lately.

*Last updated: January 2026*

## Streetlight

Launching a local visibility service. Auditing Google Business Profiles, Apple, Yelp. Turning years of informal work into a real thing.

## The Wandering Lantern

Cleveland's first children's bookstore, coming to Lakewood. Getting the space ready.

## Real estate

Looking at properties. Working with investors. Less traditional sales, more consulting and deal analysis.

## Family

My kids are the center of everything.

## Reading and thinking

Self-help, therapy, writing. How to be more honest with yourself.
