Third places are the spaces that aren't home or work, but still shape people's lives.

## The Wandering Lantern

Cleveland's first children's bookstore, opening in Lakewood. [The Wandering Lantern](https://thewanderinglantern.com) is about creating a space where kids read and parents connect.

Literacy matters. Access to books matters.

## Lakewood

Walkable, diverse, full of people who give a damn. I chose to build here.

## Community for men

Personal. Adult men in America are lonely and don't have enough spaces to be honest with each other. Working on that.

## The connection

The bookstore, the investing, the marketing work — it all comes back to community.
