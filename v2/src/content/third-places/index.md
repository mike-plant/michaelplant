Third places are the spaces that aren’t home or work, but still shape people’s lives.
They’re where connection happens outside of transactions.

## The Wandering Lantern

A children’s bookstore in Lakewood.
A place for kids to read and explore, and for parents to connect and linger.

Literacy matters. Access to books matters.

## Lakewood

Walkable. Diverse. Full of people who give a damn.
I chose to build here.

## Community for men

Personal.
Adult men in America are lonely and don’t have enough places to be honest with each other.
I’m working on that.

## The connection

The bookstore, the investing, the marketing work —
it all comes back to community.
