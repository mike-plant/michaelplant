  description: "About Michael Plant — family, building, real estate, community, and figuring it out in Lakewood, Ohio."
---

I live in Lakewood, Ohio with my family.

20+ years in digital marketing and technology. Real estate agent, then investor. Children's bookstore. Local marketing service. None of these are separate lives.

## Family

My kids come first. Everything I build is shaped by that.

## What matters

Straight talk. No pitch. Most industries have too much noise and not enough honesty.

Building things that help people. Not things that look impressive.

Community built in person, in physical spaces, by showing up.

## Personal

Self-help and therapy — the real kind. Writing. Working on being more honest with myself.

I don't have it all figured out.
