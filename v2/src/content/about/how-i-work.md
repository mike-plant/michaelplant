I'm direct, practical, and transparent. I care about fundamentals and outcomes. I don't do mystery work.

## Communication

Direct. I'll tell you what I think. I respond within a day, usually faster.

I prefer a quick call to a 20-email thread.

## Process

I start by understanding your situation. Not by pitching a solution.

If I don't think I can help, I'll tell you.

## Pricing

Flat fees when possible. Clear scope. No surprise invoices. Month-to-month retainers with no contracts.

## What I expect

Honesty. If something isn't working, tell me.

## How to start

[Book a call](https://calendly.com/michaelplant) or [email me](mailto:michael@michaelplant.com).
