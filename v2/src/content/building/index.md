This is where I keep the thinking and tools behind the work.

The medium changes — websites, software, iPad apps, analytics platforms, real estate, a bookstore. The impulse is the same: find a problem, make something that helps.

## Background

20+ years in digital marketing, product development, and analytics. Websites, apps, reporting systems. Co-founded KOBA in Australia. Marketing automation and lead generation.

## What I learned

The technology matters less than whether it solves a real problem. Most of what succeeded was simple and focused.

Most of what failed was over-engineered.

## Right now

Streetlight. The Wandering Lantern. Real estate portfolio. This site.

## How I think

Systems. How does this work? What's broken? What's the simplest fix?
