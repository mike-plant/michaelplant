I invest in real estate in the Cleveland area.

## Approach

Properties have to work on paper with conservative numbers. Realistic rents, honest rehab costs, margin for things going wrong.

I buy in neighborhoods I understand.

## What I look for

Cash flow positive from day one. Stable or improving fundamentals. Rehab that adds real value. Long-term holds.

## Current

*Updated as deals close. Follow along on the [Now page](/now/).*

## Why I share this

Too much "trust me, bro" energy in real estate investing. I'd rather show the math.
