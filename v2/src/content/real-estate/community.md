People want community, even when they don’t know how to say it.

They want to know their neighbors. They want their kids to have friends nearby. They want to feel like they belong somewhere.

That matters more now than ever. We’re more connected digitally and more isolated personally than at any point in history. Housing plays a bigger role in that than most people want to admit.

### Understanding place

You don’t understand a neighborhood from a spreadsheet.

You understand it by being there. By talking to neighbors. By noticing how changes ripple beyond a single property line.

I’ve seen the difference between investing in a place and extracting value from it. One builds trust over time. The other quietly erodes it.

Villages still exist. People are actively looking for them in everyday life. When you build with that in mind, value tends to follow.

Community isn’t a bonus feature. It’s part of the foundation.
