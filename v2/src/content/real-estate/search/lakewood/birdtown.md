Birdtown is Lakewood's most affordable and most underestimated neighborhood.

## What defines Birdtown

Birdtown sits in Lakewood's southeast corner, bounded by Madison Avenue, W. 117th Street, and the rail line. It's a historic neighborhood with deep roots — **originally built by immigrant factory workers in the late 1800s** — and it still feels like a small village tucked inside the city. The neighborhood was added to the **National Register of Historic Places in 2006**.

<div class="pull-quote">

Over 400 parcels were platted by the National Carbon Company in 1892 for its workforce. The bird-named streets — Robin, Quail, Plover, Hird — are still here, and so is the neighborhood's identity.

The housing stock is mostly smaller single-family homes, classic Lakewood doubles, and a few truly unique properties you won't see elsewhere in the city. Streets are tight, tree-lined, and very residential. Harrison Elementary sits right in the middle of the neighborhood, which reinforces the "walk everywhere" feel.

This is not a polished or flashy part of Lakewood — and that's exactly why it works for the right buyer.

## Who Birdtown tends to fit

- First-time buyers who want Lakewood schools and walkability at a lower price point
- Buyers comfortable trading size or polish for location and affordability
- Investors targeting doubles in a historically stable rental area
- People who value diversity and a true neighborhood feel

## Who it usually doesn't fit

- Buyers looking for large homes, wide lots, or quiet suburban spacing
- Anyone sensitive to industrial edges or rail proximity
- Buyers who want turnkey homes without renovation or updates

## What to watch for

**Block selection matters here.** Interior streets tend to feel quieter than edges closer to Madison or W. 117th. Condition varies widely — **two houses on the same street can feel like different price brackets entirely.** Parking and garages are inconsistent, and some older homes come with quirks that are easy to miss without local context.

## Market snapshot

<div class="callout">

**Birdtown consistently trades below Lakewood's citywide median of $327K**, which keeps demand strong. Average rents run around $1,050/month versus $1,250 citywide. Well-priced doubles move quickly. Inventory stays tight because owners tend to hold, not flip.

If you're trying to decide whether Birdtown actually fits how you live — or which streets make the most sense — that's a conversation worth having before you look at listings.
