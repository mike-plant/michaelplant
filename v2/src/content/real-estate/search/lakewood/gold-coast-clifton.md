The Gold Coast and Clifton Boulevard cover Lakewood's widest range of price points — and its biggest contrasts.

## What defines the area

The Gold Coast runs along Lake Erie near the Cleveland border and is dominated by mid-century high-rise condos with lake and skyline views. Clifton Boulevard cuts east-west just south of the lake, lined with large brick apartment buildings, stately homes, and dense rental housing.

**A few blocks can change everything here.** Living directly on Clifton is very different from living one street north or south. High-rise living is very different from historic single-family homes nearby.

<div class="pull-quote">

Only 34% of residents in this area are homeowners — one of the lowest rates in Lakewood. That shapes everything from building maintenance decisions to HOA dynamics.

</div>

This area rewards buyers who understand nuance.

## Who this area tends to fit

- Condo buyers prioritizing lake views and lower maintenance
- Buyers who value transit access and proximity to Cleveland
- Retirees and professionals downsizing from larger homes
- Buyers comfortable with HOAs and shared building decisions

## Who it usually doesn't fit

- Buyers wanting private yards or quiet streets
- Anyone uncomfortable with HOA rules, fees, or assessments
- Buyers expecting uniform property condition or pricing

## What to watch for

**Condo buildings vary significantly in maintenance, reserves, and long-term costs.** Special assessments are real, especially in older towers. Traffic noise on Clifton is noticeable. Lakefront erosion and bluff conditions matter more here than elsewhere in Lakewood.

## Market snapshot

<div class="callout">

Gold Coast condos span a wide range — **studios start between $80K and $150K, while lake-view units push past $300K**. Single-family homes in Clifton Park average around $600K on lots of 0.40 to 0.86 acres — the very top of Lakewood's market.

This area isn't about "good or bad" — it's about fit. Before searching broadly, it helps to narrow which side of Clifton (and which buildings) actually make sense for you.
