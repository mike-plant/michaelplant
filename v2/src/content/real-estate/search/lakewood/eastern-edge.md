Lakewood's eastern edge packs the city's widest range of housing into a few blocks.

## What defines the area

Along W. 117th, Lakewood meets Cleveland. Gold Coast towers, modern townhomes, historic houses, Birdtown cottages, and transit-oriented apartments all sit close together. Transit access is excellent, and **tax and school district differences across the street matter more than most buyers realize**.

<div class="pull-quote">

Lakewood's income tax rate is 1.5% versus Cleveland's 2.5% — a difference of roughly $1,000 per year for every $100K in income. One side of W. 117th feeds into Lakewood City Schools; the other into Cleveland Metropolitan. Same block, very different math.

## Who this area tends to fit

- Buyers prioritizing transit and highway access
- Condo and townhome buyers
- Buyers sensitive to municipal tax differences
- People comfortable with density and diversity

## Who it usually doesn't fit

- Buyers seeking quiet, purely residential streets
- Families needing clear school boundary certainty
- Buyers uncomfortable with urban edges

## What to watch for

School boundaries are changing. Tax differences matter. Building quality varies dramatically. One block can feel entirely different from the next.

## Market snapshot

<div class="callout">

**Pricing varies widely.** Buyers who understand the border dynamics can find strong value; those who don't often over- or under-estimate risk.

This is one of the most misunderstood parts of Lakewood — and one of the easiest places to make a decision mistake without local guidance.
