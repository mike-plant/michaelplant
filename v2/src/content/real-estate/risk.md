Most deals don’t fail because the math was wrong.

They fail because pressure arrived before limits were set.

Competition ramps up. Someone else offers more. Emotion enters the room. Suddenly people start stretching, justifying, and hoping things work out later.

That’s where mistakes happen.

### Setting limits early

Before I ever bid, I decide my maximum. Not my minimum.

What I’m willing to do and still meet my goals given the structure of the deal. Sometimes breaking even makes sense because of long-term income or equity. Sometimes it doesn’t.

That decision gets made before pressure enters the room.

Walking away early is easier than walking away once you’re emotionally invested.

### Why math alone isn’t protection

On paper, real estate looks simple. Buy low. Improve. Sell or rent. Move on.

In real life, neighborhoods, tenants, maintenance, and timing matter more than spreadsheets suggest. You can make a deal work mathematically and still create something that fails over time.

Speed without judgment isn’t strategy. It’s just gambling with better vocabulary.

Knowing when not to do a deal is where most of the value actually lives.
