If you're investing in Cleveland-area real estate, I can help you avoid expensive mistakes.

## What I help with

Deal analysis. Purchase price, rehab costs, ARV, rent projections, cash-on-cash return. Math, not hype.

DSCR financing. What lenders look for. Whether a deal qualifies.

Market context. I live here. I know which neighborhoods are trending and which ones are traps.

BRRR strategy. Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat. It works when done right.

## What I don't do

I'm not a wholesaler. I don't have a course. I'm an investor who happens to be licensed. I'd rather help you make a good decision than push a transaction.
