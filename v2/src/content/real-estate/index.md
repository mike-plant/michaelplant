This is the real estate side of what I do: representing buyers and sellers, working with investors, and building my own portfolio.

## How I'm involved

**As an investor** — I buy, rehab, and hold rental properties in the Cleveland area. I think long-term and I like deals that make sense on paper before I touch them.

**As a consultant** — I help other investors evaluate deals, understand DSCR financing, and navigate the Cleveland market.

**As a licensed agent** — I'm with RED1 Realty. My [agent site](https://michaelplant.red1realty.com/) has listings and search.

## What I care about

Neighborhoods. What makes one block thrive while another struggles. Real estate as community infrastructure, not just transactions.

Investing should be transparent. I'd rather show my math.
